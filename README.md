quotesy
=======

Simple Python Script pulling quotes from the internet and then printing it out with cowsay in terminal

-Make sure to have cowsay installed.

<p>
todo:
Convert the parse to bsoup or lxml and move away from regex.
add more stuff when something comes to mind.
randomize between cow files so not just tux.
add time and date(maybe).
add use of notify-send or python-notify.
add the choice for more then intelligent quotes. (randomize).
make use of install(1) or distutils to make it installable(package).
